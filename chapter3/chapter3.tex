\section{Definition}
Definition of screening masses, screening correlators, relation with 0-temp.
mass.
\section{Analytic results}
Review of analytically known results (EFT, mesons, baryons)
\section{Lattice results}
Review of lattice determinations (mesons, baryons)
\subsection{JHEP '22}
Dedicated section on meson paper of '22: non-perturbative high-temperature 
strategy, comparison with PT, splitting\\
\section{Aim of the thesis}
Conclude chapter with the \alert{aim of the thesis:} compute baryonic screening
masses from the lattice at high T, and at NLO in EFT\\
Tackle exponential problem in non-static mesons, detail spin-splitting
